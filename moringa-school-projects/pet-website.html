         <p1>The german shepherd! This is the most fierce dog that the world currently knows.
              I prefer to regard the dog as a human and so i'll be using "him" in place of "the dog"
              He is man's best friend and that is also how scientists argue and which i tend to believe
              is true. That is why he is my pet.</p>
         <p2>He is a well trained dog and therefore guards men and in general, humans from impending danger.
              You can imagine what can happen if you tried to attack me and the dog is right behind me. Probably
              you would be rushed to the hospital like nobody's business.</p2>
         <p3>I would not like to go much into details because if i had to, you would probably run off from my
              website.thankyou for visiting my site and take it into consideration to having a pet such as mine.</p3>

                                        <p4>HE IS A BEAST</P4>
