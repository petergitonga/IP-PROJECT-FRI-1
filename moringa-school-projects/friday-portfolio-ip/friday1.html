   <body>
        <p1>Hey there! I'm guessing that you are intrested in knowing about me and why i regard to myself
            as the designated one. I'll begin from my childhood history so backle up for an interesting
            journey to the "GITONGA WORLD!"
            First i would like to clarify the meaning of my name and where it came from;
            <ul>
                <li>peter means "THE ROCK"</li>
                <li>njagi means "ZEBRA"</li>
                <li>gitonga means"RICH MAN</li>
            In my community, the name "Gitonga" is believed to be given to people destined for greatness.
            I thought you should know.   
            </ul>
