      <h1>THE CHOOSEN ONE</h1>
      <h2>Designated Gitonga</h2>
   <body>
        <p1>Hey there! I'm guessing that you are intrested in knowing about me and why i regard to myself
            as the designated one. I'll begin from my childhood history so backle up for an interesting
            journey to the "GITONGA WORLD!"
            First i would like to clarify the meaning of my name and where it came from;
            <ul>
                <li>peter means "THE ROCK"</li>
                <li>njagi means "ZEBRA"</li>
                <li>gitonga means"RICH MAN</li>
            In my community, the name "Gitonga" is believed to be given to people destined for greatness.
            I thought you should know.
            </ul>
        </p1>

        <p2>I'll start by a brief history on my educational background. I was born in the late 90's and a
            few years later i joined a nursery school and started my primary school course in "Musa Gitau primary school"
            Apparently at that time, my mum was the deputy principal in the school. I had to finish my primary school
            course in that school by default since both my older brother and sister had experienced the
            same. 8 years later i completed my primary school course and i qualified to join a county
            government high school.
        </p2>

        <p3>Later on the next year, i joined "Nguviu boys high school". The school is located in the mount kenya
            region in embu. You can imagine the cold and severe weather in the place having lived in Nirobi
            all your life. After 2 years i was unable to adapt to the freezing weather especially in the
            morning. I therefore requested for a transfer and i joined "Anestar High School". After 2 years,
            i completed my high school course in Anestar with flying colours.
        </p3>
        <p4>
            Now this year, i applied to join the university to pursue IT as my degree course which i was
            succssesfully accepted by the "University of Nairobi [UON]". Meanwhile, i was doing driving
            and one day i came across a friend who was attending classes here at Moringa school and she
            triggered my interest about coding. Back then when i was in high school i was so much into
            medicine since my dad was a doctor and i liked everything about what he did. As i advanced into
            form 3, i realised that my passion was more in IT than in medicine and so i decide to join moringa
            school so that i could strengthen my degree with this course and also keep myself busy with
            something i like doing as i await to join the university.
