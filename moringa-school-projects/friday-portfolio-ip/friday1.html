      <h1>THE CHOOSEN ONE</h1>
      <h2>Designated Gitonga</h2>
   <body>
        <p1>Hey there! I'm guessing that you are intrested in knowing about me and why i regard to myself
            as the designated one. I'll begin from my childhood history so backle up for an interesting
            journey to the "GITONGA WORLD!"
            First i would like to clarify the meaning of my name and where it came from;
            <ul>
                <li>peter means "THE ROCK"</li>
                <li>njagi means "ZEBRA"</li>
                <li>gitonga means"RICH MAN</li>
            In my community, the name "Gitonga" is believed to be given to people destined for greatness.
            I thought you should know.
            </ul>
        </p1>

        <p2>I'll start by a brief history on my educational background. I was born in the late 90's and a
            few years later i joined a nursery school and started my primary school course in "Musa Gitau primary school"
            Apparently at that time, my mum was the deputy principal in the school. I had to finish my primary school
            course in that school by default since both my older brother and sister had experienced the
            same. 8 years later i completed my primary school course and i qualified to join a county
            government high school.
